# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to look at what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped together to create a classification system for a potential investment.

## Results

#### 3D Scatterplot With Clusters

Here, we can determine similarities between different cryptocurrencies using the Principal Component (PC) Algorithm, which has data scaled and grouped into 3 different components.

#### 2D Scatterplot

Here, we can determine the relationship between "total coins mined" and "total coin supply" only

## Summary

Using unsupervised machine allows us to parse through data which doesn't have a known output, in order to determine cluster patterns to find possible outputs. From these visualizations, we can determine better grouping and insight through the 3D scatterplot with clusters than we can with the 2D scatterplot.
